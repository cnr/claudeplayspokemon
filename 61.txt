This is a critical discovery! I've reached (12, 31) and
can now see that coordinates (8-11, 27) through (11, 30)
are marked in white on the navigator overlay, which means
they're navigable. This is the path that leads to the
ladder I spotted earlier at (15, 27).
I can see:
1. The ladder at (15, 27) is still visible and marked in
red.
2. However, there's now a navigable path at positions (8-
11, 27) through (11, 30), which might lead to a way to
access the ladder.
3. Specifically, I can navigate to (11, 27), which appears
to be closest to the ladder.
This is likely the ladder that connects to the southern
chamber of B1F (21, 17), which is part of the exit path.
Let me navigate to (11, 27) to get closer to the ladder
and see if I can access it from there.
