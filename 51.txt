I've reached (38, 16) and can see that the path continues
southward. The navigator overlay shows navigable spaces at
positions (36-38, 17) through (36-38, 20). Let me continue
exploring this southern path to see if there's a ladder or
other feature.
I notice there's what appears to be a lighter colored area
or tile at the bottom left of the screen, at approximately
(35-36, 19-20). This could potentially be a ladder or
special feature. Let me navigate to (36, 20) to
investigate that area more closely.
