I've encountered a wild Zubat while trying to navigate to
(21, 8). I need to run from this battle to preserve my
team's health, which is already in a critical state (Sprou
at 10/69 HP, Sand fainted). Let me follow the standard
procedure to flee:
1. Press "a" to advance through the dialog
2. Navigate to "RUN" in the battle menu
3. Select "RUN" to flee from the battle

Using tool: use_emulator - Buttons: ['a']
