I've reached (38, 12) and can see that there's no direct
path eastward beyond this point - coordinates (39, 12) and
beyond are marked in red on the navigator overlay. There's
a wall or barrier at column 39 blocking further progress.
Let me analyze what I've found so far:
1. I've explored the eastern path in Mt. Moon B2F and
found that it ends at a wall at column 39.
2. I've checked the bridge structures at (32, 15) and
found they're not functional ladders.
3. I previously found that the B1F floor is divided into
two separate chambers (northern and southern) with no
direct connection between them.
4. I need to find a ladder in B2F that connects to the
southern chamber of B1F (21, 17).
Let me look at other paths I haven't fully explored yet:
1. There's a path extending southward from my current
position at (36-38, 16).
2. I haven't fully explored the western part of B2F where
the Team Rocket member is located around (28, 11).
Since I'm closer to the southern path, let me navigate to
(38, 16) to explore that direction first.
