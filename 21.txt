<thinking>
I've reached (20, 5), but I can see from the navigator
overlay that the areas to the north (rows 1-4) are all
marked in red, indicating they're inaccessible from my
current position. Similarly, all the positions to the east
beyond column 22 at my current row are also marked in red.
This means I can't directly access the ladder that might
be at around (25, 4) from this side. I need to look for an
alternative path.
From my current position, I can navigate to positions (21,
5) or (22, 5) to the east. Let me try moving to (22, 5) to
see if there's any access to other areas from there.
