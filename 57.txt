<thinking>
I've reached (28, 31) and can see that:
1. There's a solid barrier of rock/walls at rows 27-30,
columns 24-31. This confirms that the ladder-like
structure at columns 29-30, rows 24-28 is not directly
accessible from the southern path.
2. There's a path extending westward from my current
position with navigable coordinates at (24-27, 31) through
(24-27, 32).
3. There's also a path that extends southward at row 32
which I can access.
Since I've confirmed that I can't directly access the
ladder-like structure from my current position, I should
continue exploring other paths. I notice the path extends
westward to columns 24-27. Let me navigate to (24, 31) to
see if there's a ladder or other path in that direction.
