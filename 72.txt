<thinking>
I see I'm now on the move selection screen for Sprou. I
pressed "a" and it automatically selected FIGHT rather
than allowing me to navigate to PkMn. Now I need to
reconsider my strategy given that I'm already in the move
selection menu.
Looking at the available moves:
1. TACKLE (PP: 14/35) - Normal-type move, standard damage
2. POISONPOWDER (PP: 34/35) - Poisons the opponent,
causing damage over time
3. LEECH SEED (PP: 6/10) - Drains HP from opponent each
turn, healing Sprou
4. VINE WHIP (PP: 2/10) - Grass-type move, stronger damage
but low PP
Given that Sprou has critically low HP (10/69), my best
strategy is to use LEECH SEED. This will:
1. Start draining HP from RATTATA each turn, which can
potentially heal Sprou enough to survive
2. Deal some damage over time without requiring additional
attacks
3. Potentially allow Sprou to survive long enough to
switch to Puff
I need to press "down" twice to navigate from TACKLE to
LEECH SEED, then press "a" to select it.
