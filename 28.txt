<thinking>
I'm now at the battle menu with the wild Geodude (Level
10). The cursor is currently on FIGHT, and I need to
navigate to RUN to escape the battle. To do this, I need
to press "right" to move to PkMn, and then "down" to move
to RUN.
Let me navigate to RUN by pressing "right" and then
â€œdown".

Using tool: use_emulator - Buttons: ['right']
