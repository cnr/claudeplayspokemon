<thinking>
As I suspected, after finishing the dialog with the Team
Rocket member, I've entered a battle with a Team Rocket
Grunt. I need to be extremely careful here because Sprou
is at critically low HP (10/69) and Sand is already
fainted. I should try to run from this battle immediately
to preserve Sprou's remaining HP.
The standard battle approach is to navigate to the RUN
option by pressing "right" to move to PkMn, and then
“down" to move to RUN. The battle screen shows that the
Team Rocket Grunt has a Pokémon, likely a Koffing or Ekans
based on the red/orange coloring, but I need to focus on
running rather than fighting.
Let me press "right" to navigate to PkMn, then "down" to
move to RUN.
