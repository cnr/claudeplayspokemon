Perfect! I've successfully navigated to LEECH SEED, which
has 6/10 PP remaining. This is the best move to use in
this situation because:
1. It will drain HP from RATTATA each turn
2. It will heal some HP back to Sprou, potentially
allowing Sprou to survive longer
3. It deals damage each turn without requiring additional
attacks
4. It's especially useful against a Level 13 RATTATA which
likely doesn't have very high HP
Now I need to press â€œa" to select LEECH SEED and use it
against RATTATA.
