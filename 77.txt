<thinking>
I'm back at the main battle menu. The LEECH SEED has been
successfully applied to RATTATA, but it hasn't drained any
HP yet - the HP drain will happen at the end of the next
turn.
Now I need to decide on my next move:
1. Use FIGHT > POISONPOWDER: This would add another status
effect to RATTATA, causing it to lose HP from both poison
and LEECH SEED every turn. The downside is that if RATTATA
attacks and hits Sprou, Sprou might faint.
2. Use PkMn > Switch to Puff: This would protect Sprou
from potential KO, but RATTATA would get a free attack
against Puff. Puff has more HP (23/34) so could better
absorb the hit, and could then use SING to put RATTATA to
sleep.
Given Sprou's critically low HP (10/69), I think the safer
option is to switch to Puff. Even though RATTATA will get
a free attack, Puff has enough HP to survive, and we can
then try to put RATTATA to sleep with SING.
Let me press "right" to navigate to the PkMn option to
switch Pokemon.
