<thinking>
I'm now at (22, 6) in Mt. Moon B2F, but I still don't see
a path that leads east beyond column 22. I need to
continue exploring to find a different path.
I notice there's another feature visible in the bottom
right corner of the screen - it looks like a ladder. Let's
navigate to (22, 10) to get closer to it and see if it's a
usable ladder that might connect to a different part of
the cave.
