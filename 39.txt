<thinking>
I'm back in the overworld at Mt. Moon B2F, at coordinates
(31, 16). Looking at the navigator overlay, I can see:
1. There's what appears to be a Team Rocket member
(character wearing black) at around (28, 17).
2. I can see fence/railing structures at rows 15 and 19.
3. Most coordinates in rows 19-20 are marked in red,
indicating they're inaccessible.
4. There appears to be a ladder or structure at (32, 15).
From my current position at (31, 16), I should examine the
position at (32, 15) to see if it's a usable ladder. This
could potentially be a ladder that connects to the
southern chamber of B1F, which is part of the exit path.
Let me navigate to (32, 15) to investigate.
