<thinking>
I've reached (36, 20) and can see that:
1. The lighter colored area I saw earlier is a raised
platform or different elevation. It appears to be
inaccessible from my current position, as coordinates (32-
35, 20) and (32-35, 19) are marked in red on the navigator
overlay.
2. However, I notice that below this raised platform area,
there's a path extending westward at rows 22-24, with
navigable coordinates at (32-35, 22) through (32-35, 24).
3. There's a path southward from my current position with
navigable coordinates at (36-38, 21) through (36-38, 24).
Let me continue exploring the southern path by navigating
to (36, 24) to see if there's a ladder or other feature in
that direction.
