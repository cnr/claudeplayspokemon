<thinking>
I've moved the cursor to LEECH SEED. I notice that we
already used LEECH SEED earlier in the battle, and it's
currently active on RATTATA. Using it again would be
redundant as it doesn't stack.
I need to press "down" one more time to navigate to VINE
WHIP, which is Sprou's strongest damage-dealing move.
