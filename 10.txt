<thinking>
I've reached coordinates (25, 12) in Mt. Moon B2F, and I
can see a ladder directly above me at approximately (25,
9). This is exactly what I've been looking for - a ladder
that likely connects to a different part of B1F than where
I came from.
Looking at the navigator overlay, I can see that the
coordinates around the ladder (23-27, 8-10) are marked in
red, indicating they're not directly navigable from my
current position. I need to find a way to reach this
ladder.
Looking at the navigable spaces, I can see there's a path
to the west that might lead to a way to access this
ladder. Let me navigate to (21, 8) to explore the western
part of this chamber and see if there's a path that leads
to the ladder.
