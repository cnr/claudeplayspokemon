<thinking>
I've encountered another wild Pok√©mon while trying to
navigate to (37, 12). This time it's a Zubat again. I need
to run from this battle to preserve Sprou's critically low
The dialog shows "99999999999999999" which seems to be a
glitch or unexpected output. According to the RAM state,
my current location is still Mt. Moon B2F, but my
coordinates have changed to (32, 12).
Let me navigate the battle menu to run from this Zubat, as
I've done with previous encounters. I need to press
"right" and "down" to navigate to the RUN option, and then
press "a" to select it.
