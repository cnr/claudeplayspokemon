<thinking>
I've reached (20, 31) and can see that the path continues
westward with navigable coordinates at (16-19, 31) through
(16-19, 32). I should continue exploring westward to see
if there's a ladder or other feature that might lead to
the exit path.
Let me navigate to (16, 31) to see what's in that
direction.
