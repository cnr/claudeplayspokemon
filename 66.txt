<thinking>
I've encountered a Team Rocket member at (11, 19), who is
saying "TEAM ROCKET will find the fossils". This is an NPC
that I need to interact with before I can proceed. I
should press "a" to advance the dialog and see what else
this Team Rocket member has to say. It might provide
valuable information about the area or might lead to a
battle.
My current location is Mt. Moon B2F at coordinates (11,
19). The appearance of the Team Rocket member confirms
that the Zubat-like symbol I saw earlier was indeed an
NPC, not a wild Pok√©mon. Let me press "a" to continue the
dialog.
