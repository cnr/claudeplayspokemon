Pressing "a" at coordinates (33, 15) also didn't do
anything. This confirms that this structure is not a
ladder, but rather some kind of bridge or decorative
element in the cave. My assumption that it was a ladder
was incorrect.
I need to continue exploring to find a ladder that leads
to a different part of B1F than where I came from. Looking
at the screenshot, I can see there's the black-haired NPC
(likely a Team Rocket member) at around (28, 17). I should
talk to them as they might provide useful information.
Let me navigate to (28, 17) to talk to this NPC.
