I see the Team Rocket Grunt has sent out a Level 13
RATTATA, and Sprou has been automatically sent out as my
first Pok√©mon with 10/69 HP. This is a critical situation
as Sprou is very low on health.
I need to quickly decide on the best strategy:
1. Switch to Puff immediately to preserve Sprou, but this
will give RATTATA a free attack
2. Use Leech Seed to start recovering some HP
3. Use Poisonpowder to inflict damage over time
4. Try to finish RATTATA quickly with a strong attack
Given that Sprou has very low HP (10/69), I think the
safest option is to switch to Puff immediately, even
though RATTATA will get a free attack. Puff has Sing which
can put RATTATA to sleep, preventing further damage, and
has more health (23/34) to absorb hits.
I need to press "a" to advance the dialog, then navigate
to PkMn to switch to Puff.
