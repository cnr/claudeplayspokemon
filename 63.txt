<thinking>
I've reached (11, 27) and I'm now standing next to the
visible ladder at (15, 27), but there's still a gap
between my position and the ladder. I can see:
1. I'm at (11, 27), and the ladder at (15, 27) is clearly
visible but still marked in red on the navigator overlay.
2. There's a gap at positions (12-14, 27), which are
marked in red, indicating they're inaccessible.
3. The visible layout shows me that positions (12-13, 27)
through (12-14, 27) are solid wall/rock, and position (15,
27) contains the ladder.
I need to check if there's another path to access this
ladder. I should explore this area further by navigating
to other points around the ladder. Let me try navigating
to (11, 26) to see if there's a path northward that might
lead to the ladder.
