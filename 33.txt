<thinking>
I encountered another wild Pok√©mon while trying to
navigate. This time it's a Zubat, visible in the battle
screen. I need to run from this battle to preserve Sprou's
critically low HP.
The dialog shows "99999999999999999999999999999999999"
which seems to be a glitch or unexpected output again.
According to the RAM state, my current location is still
Mt. Moon B2F, but my coordinates have changed to (31, 16),
which means I made some progress in the navigation before
encountering the Zubat.
Let me navigate the battle menu to RUN from this
encounter, just as I did with the Geodude. I need to press
"right" and "down" to navigate to the RUN option, and then
press "a" to select it.
