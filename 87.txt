As expected, the dialog confirms that "Puff fainted!" and
I'm now at the Pokémon selection screen to choose which
Pokémon to send out next. The cursor is currently on Puff,
which is marked as "FNT" (fainted).
I need to press "up" to move the cursor to Sprou, who is
my only remaining Pokémon with HP (10/69), and then press
"a" to select Sprou.
