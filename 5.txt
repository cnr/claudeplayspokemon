<thinking>
I'm now at coordinates (29, 16) in Mt. Moon B2F, and I'm
facing the Team Rocket member below me. The navigator
shows I'm still at the same coordinates (29, 16) as
before, which suggests my down movement might not have
completed as expected. Let me try again to move down and
face the NPC at (29, 17).
