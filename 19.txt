<thinking>
Now I'm back in the overworld at Mt. Moon B2F, at
coordinates (22, 12). Looking at the navigator overlay, I
can see there's what appears to be a ladder-like structure
at (25, 9), but coordinates (23, 8), (24, 8), and (25, 8)
are marked in red, indicating they're out of reach.
The coordinates (20, 8), (21, 8), and (22, 8) are
navigable, so I could try to approach the ladder area from
the northwest. I need to navigate to (20, 8) and then see
if I can reach the ladder from there.
My goal is to find a ladder that connects to the southern
chamber of B1F, which will lead to the exit path. Based on
the overlay, I should navigate to (20, 8) first to try to
reach the northwest corner where the ladder might be.
I'll use the navigator tool to move to (20, 8) to see if I
can access the ladder from there.
