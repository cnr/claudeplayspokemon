<thinking>
It seems I'm still at coordinates (29, 16), and I'm unable
to move down to (29, 17) as that position is currently
occupied by the Team Rocket NPC. This is expected - in
Pokemon, you can't occupy the same tile as an NPC.
Instead, I should be able to interact with the NPC by
pressing the "a" button while facing them.
Looking at the screen, I can see I'm directly above the
Team Rocket member. Let me press "a" to talk to them and
see if they provide any useful information.
