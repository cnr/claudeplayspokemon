I've successfully switched from Sprou to Puff, and now
Puff (Jigglypuff) is in battle against the enemy RATTATA.
The dialog shows "Enemy RATTATA use", which means RATTATA
is about to attack Puff (since RATTATA gets a free attack
when I switch Pok√©mon).
I need to press "a" to continue the dialog and see what
attack RATTATA uses and how much damage Puff takes. After
that, I'll be able to select a move for Puff, and I'll
want to use SING to try to put RATTATA to sleep.
