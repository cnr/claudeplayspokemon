I've reached (11, 22) and can now see a very important
development! The coordinates (12-16, 18) are now marked in
white on the navigator overlay, which means they're
navigable. This is a critical discovery, as it means I can
access the top section where the Zubat-like symbol
(possibly an NPC or trainer) is located at (15, 22).
I can see:
1. The Zubat-like symbol is clearly visible at (15, 22),
with positions (14-16, 20) through (14-16, 22) marked in
red, indicating they're inaccessible.
2. However, positions (12-16, 18) are marked in white,
which means I can navigate there.
3. This might provide a way to access the area where the
ladder is located at (15, 27).
Let me navigate to (12, 18) to explore the newly
accessible area and see if there's a path that leads to
the ladder.
