<thinking>
I've successfully navigated to (20, 8), but I can see from
the navigator overlay that there's no direct access to
positions (23, 4) through (25, 4) where I believe the
ladder might be located - those coordinates are marked in
red. There's a wall blocking access from this side.
Looking at the navigable spaces, I should try to move
north to see if there's a path around. I can navigate to
(20, 5) which is the northernmost navigable coordinate
from my current position, and see if there's any way to
access the ladder area from there.
Let me use the navigator to move to (20, 5) to continue
exploring the northern part of this room.
