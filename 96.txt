<thinking>
The battle is continuing. The dialog shows "ROCKET is
about to use", which means the Team Rocket Grunt has
another Pokémon to send out. I need to press "a" to
advance the dialog and see what Pokémon ROCKET will use
next.
This is concerning because Sprou is still at critically
low HP (10/69), and both Puff and Sand are fainted. I'll
need to be very careful with this next opponent.
