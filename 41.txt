<thinking>
I tried pressing "a" while standing at (32, 15), but
nothing happened. This confirms that this bridge-like
structure is purely decorative and not a functional
ladder. I need to continue exploring to find a ladder that
connects to the southern chamber of B1F.
Let me look at what area to explore next:
1. I can see some paths extending eastward toward
positions (36, 12) through (37, 12).
2. There's a Team Rocket member at around (28, 17) that I
haven't interacted with yet.
3. There's also what appears to be a ladder or special
feature at the top of the screen around (28, 11), though
that area is marked in red on the navigator overlay.
Since I'm looking for a ladder to the southern chamber of
B1F, I should try exploring the eastern path more
thoroughly. Let me navigate to (37, 12) to see if there
are any ladders or connections in that direction.
