<thinking>
I'm in a critical situation in Mt. Moon B2F with my team
in poor condition. Let me analyze the current state:
1. Current battle with a Level 10 Zubat
2. Team status:
- Sprou (Ivysaur): 10/69 HP - CRITICALLY LOW
- Puff (Jigglypuff): 23/34 HP
- Sand (Pidgey): 0/29 HP - FAINTED
The feedback correctly points out that I have many
redundant files related to Mt. Moon and emergency
situations. Before taking any action, I should consolidate
these files after handling the immediate battle.
My immediate priority is to run from this Zubat battle to
preserve Sprou's remaining HP, then continue my search for
the exit path. Based on my previous exploration, I've
discovered the critical ladder at Mt. Moon 1F (5, 5)
connecting to B1F (21, 17), which is part of the exit
path. I need to find a ladder sequence that leads to the
southern chamber of B1F.
The dialog shows I'm in a battle screen with options
FIGHT, PKMN, ITEM, RUN - and I should select RUN
immediately.
