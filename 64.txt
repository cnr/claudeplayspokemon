<thinking>
I've moved to (11, 26) and can now see a Zubat-like symbol
at the top of the screen around (15, 22). This might be a
wild Pok√©mon that appears in the area or possibly another
trainer.
I can see that the coordinates (12-16, 22) through (12-16,
26) are still marked in red on the navigator overlay,
indicating they're inaccessible. This confirms that
there's no direct path to the ladder at (15, 27) from this
side.
Let me continue exploring the area by navigating to (11,
22) to get closer to the Zubat symbol and see if there's
any path that leads eastward toward the ladder.
