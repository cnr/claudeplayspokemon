<thinking>
I've reached (27, 12) and can now see more of the area.
There's what appears to be another character (possibly a
Team Rocket member or other NPC) at around (28, 10). I
also notice there's a ladder at (25, 9), but it's still
marked in red on the navigator overlay, indicating it's
not directly accessible from my current position.
I can see that there are navigable spaces at (31, 12),
(32, 12), and other coordinates to the east, which means I
can continue exploring in that direction. There's also
what appears to be a bridge-like structure at (26, 15) and
(27, 15).
Since I'm looking for a path to reach the southern chamber
of B1F, I should continue exploring eastward to see if
there's a ladder that connects to it. Let me navigate to
(31, 12) to continue my exploration.
