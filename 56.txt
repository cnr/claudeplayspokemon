I've reached (32, 28) and can see that there's an
important development in the navigable areas:
1. The coordinates (28, 31) through (31, 32) have now
become navigable, whereas before they were marked in red.
This means I've found a connection to the area to the west
that contains the ladder-like structure I saw earlier.
2. There's still a barrier at rows 29-30 that prevents
direct access to the ladder-like structure at columns 29-
30, rows 24-28.
3. The path continues southward, with navigable
coordinates at (32, 29) through (32, 32).
Given this new information, I should navigate to (28, 31)
to get closer to the ladder-like structure and see if
there's a path that leads to it.
