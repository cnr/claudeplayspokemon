I'm back in the overworld at Mt. Moon B2F, at coordinates
(32, 12). Looking at the navigator overlay, I can see
several important features:
1. There's a Team Rocket member (character wearing black)
above me at approximately (28, 11).
2. There appears to be what might be a ladder at (33, 9),
but it's marked in red, indicating it's not directly
accessible.
3. There's a bridge structure at (32-33, 15) that I can
navigate to.
4. All coordinates in rows 8-11 are marked in red,
indicating they're inaccessible from my current position.
5. I can navigate eastward to positions (36, 12) through
(37, 12).
I need to continue exploring to find a ladder that
connects to the southern chamber of B1F (21, 17), which is
part of the exit path. Since I've already checked the
bridge structures at (32, 15), I should explore eastward
to see if there's a ladder or other path in that
direction.
Let me navigate to (37, 12) to explore the eastern path.
