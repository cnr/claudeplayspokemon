Great! I successfully ran away from the Zubat battle. The
dialog shows "Got away safely!" which means Sprou's
critical HP has been preserved.
Now I need to press â€œa" again to clear the dialog and
return to the overworld. After that, I'll continue
exploring the northwest corner of Mt. Moon B2F to find the
ladder at B2F (25, 9) which might be a key part of the
exit path.
According to my previous exploration, I've discovered that
the B1F floor is divided into two separate chambers with
no direct connection:
1. Northern chamber: Contains ladder at B1F (25, 9)
connecting to 1F (17, 11)
2. Southern chamber: Contains ladder at B1F (21, 17)
connecting to 1F (5, 5) - part of exit path
My goal is to find the ladder sequence that will lead me
to the southern chamber of B1F, which connects to the exit
path. Before I take action, I should clear the dialog and
proceed with exploration.
