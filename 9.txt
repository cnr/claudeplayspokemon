<thinking>
Now that I've closed the dialog with the Team Rocket
member, I need to continue my exploration to find a ladder
that leads to a different part of B1F than where I came
from.
Looking at the navigator overlay, I can see there are
several areas I haven't fully explored yet:
1. The western path around coordinates (25-27, 12-18)
2. The northwestern path around coordinates (25-27, 12-14)
Let me navigate to (25, 12) to explore the northwestern
corner of this chamber, as there might be a ladder or
pathway there that I haven't discovered yet.

Using tool: navigator - Target: (25, 12)
