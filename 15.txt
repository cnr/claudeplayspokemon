<thinking>
I apologize for the formatting error. Let me try again
with the proper formatting for the use_emulator tool. I
need to run from this Zubat battle immediately to preserve
Sprou's critically low HP. The correct button sequence
would be to select "RUN" and then press "A" to confirm.
Looking at the battle screen, I can see that "RUN" is in
the bottom-right corner. However, I don't see "run" as a
valid button in the use_emulator function - I should use
the directional buttons to navigate to RUN and then press
"a" to select it.
Based on the dialog, it shows:
FIGHT>PkMn
ITEM RUN
This means I need to navigate to RUN which is in the
bottom right. From FIGHT (top left with cursor), I need to
press "right" to get to PKMN, then "down" to get to RUN,
and then press "a" to select it.

Using tool: use_emulator - Buttons: ['right', 'down', 'a']
