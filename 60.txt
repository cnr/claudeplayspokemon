<thinking>
I've reached (16, 31) and can now see a very important
discovery - I can see what appears to be a ladder at (15,
27)! This ladder is marked in red on the navigator
overlay, which means it's not directly accessible from my
current position, but it's likely what I've been looking
for.
Looking at the navigator overlay, I can see:
1. The ladder at (15, 27) is visible but marked in red,
indicating it's not directly accessible from my current
position.
2. The path continues westward with navigable coordinates
at (12-15, 31) through (12-15, 32).
3. All coordinates in rows 27-30 are marked in red,
confirming that there's no direct path to the ladder.
I should continue exploring westward by navigating to (12,
31) to see if there's a path that might eventually lead to
this ladder.
