I've successfully sent out Sprou and now I'm at the main
battle menu with the cursor on FIGHT. I need to decide on
the best strategy with Sprou's critically low HP (10/69):
1. VINE WHIP (2/10 PP): Most effective damage-dealing move
against RATTATA (Normal type), but very low PP remaining
2. TACKLE (14/35 PP): Standard damage, good PP remaining
3. LEECH SEED (5/10 PP): Already active on RATTATA, no
need to use again
4. POISONPOWDER (34/35 PP): Would cause additional damage
over time
Given that LEECH SEED is already active, I should focus on
dealing direct damage to finish the battle quickly before
RATTATA can attack again. Since VINE WHIP is Sprou's
strongest move and the situation is critical, I'll use it
despite the low PP.
I need to press "a" to select FIGHT and then navigate to
VINE WHIP.
