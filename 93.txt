Perfect! I've successfully navigated to VINE WHIP, which
is Sprou's strongest attack with 2/10 PP remaining. Now I
need to press "a" to select VINE WHIP and use it against
RATTATA. Given that Sprou is Level 24 and RATTATA is only
Level 13, VINE WHIP should do significant damage and
hopefully defeat it quickly.
