<thinking>
I'm now at (22, 5) in Mt. Moon B2F, but I still can't
access the areas to the north or east as they're marked in
red on the navigator overlay. I'm starting to think this
part of the cave doesn't have a direct path to the ladder
I was looking for.
Let me recap what I've discovered about the Mt. Moon
layout:
1. Mt. Moon 1F (17, 11) connects to B1F (25, 9) - northern
chamber
2. Mt. Moon B1F (25, 9) connects to B2F (25, 9) - I
haven't found this ladder yet in my current exploration
3. Mt. Moon B1F (21, 17) connects to 1F (5, 5) - southern
chamber, part of exit path
4. Mt. Moon B1F (21, 17) connects to B2F (21, 17) - I
confirmed this connection earlier
5. B1F is divided into two separate chambers (northern and
southern) with no direct connection between them
Let me try to navigate to (22, 6) and continue exploring
southward to see if I can find another path. I need to
find a way to reach the southern chamber of B1F (21, 17)
from B2F, which will connect to the exit path at 1F (5,
