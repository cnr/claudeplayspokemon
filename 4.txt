Perfect! I'm now at coordinates (29, 16) in Mt. Moon B2F,
and I can see the black-haired NPC right below me at
coordinates (29, 17). This appears to be a Team Rocket
member based on their appearance. Let me talk to them by
facing down and pressing â€œa" to see if they provide any
useful information about the exit or other aspects of Mt.
Moon.
First, I'll move down to coordinate (29, 17) to be in
front of the NPC.
