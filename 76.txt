Perfect! Sprou successfully used LEECH SEED on the enemy
RATTATA, and the message “Enemy RATTATA was seeded!"
confirms it was effective. This means that at the end of
each turn, RATTATA will lose some HP which will be
transferred to Sprou. This is the ideal scenario given
Sprou's critically low HP.
Now I need to press “a" to continue with the battle and
see if LEECH SEED drains any HP from RATTATA on this turn.
I should then continue with a strategy to either:
1. Use TACKLE to deal direct damage while LEECH SEED works
in the background
2. Use POISONPOWDER to stack another status effect for
additional damage over time
3. Consider switching to Puff if Sprou's HP gets even
lower
Let me press "a" to continue with the battle.
