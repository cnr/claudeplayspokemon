I'm back in the overworld at coordinates (27, 13) in Mt.
Moon B2F. Looking at the navigator overlay, I can see:
1. There are NPC/trainers visible on the screen - one
appears to be a Team Rocket member wearing black at
approximately (28, 10-11) and another character at the
bottom of the screen around (29, 17).
2. There's what appears to be a ladder at the top of the
screen around (25-26, 9), but all the coordinates in rows
9-11 are marked in red, indicating they're not directly
accessible from my current position.
3. There's a bridge-like structure at (26-27, 15) that I
can access.
4. I can move eastward to (31, 12) and (32, 12) to
continue exploring in that direction.
Given my team's critical condition, I need to focus on
finding a path to exit Mt. Moon. I should continue
exploring eastward to see if I can find a ladder that
leads to the southern chamber of B1F, which connects to
the exit path.
Let me navigate to (31, 12) to continue my exploration in
the eastern direction.
