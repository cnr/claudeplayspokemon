I encountered a wild Zubat while trying to navigate to
(31, 12). I need to run from this battle immediately to
preserve Sprou's critically low HP (10/69).
The battle screen shows a Zubat, and the dialog shows
"99999999999999999999999999999999999" which seems to be a
glitch or unexpected output. Regardless, I need to
navigate the battle menu to select "RUN" and escape from
this battle.
According to the RAM state, my current location is still
Mt. Moon B2F at coordinates (27, 13), which means I moved
one tile down from my previous position before
encountering the Zubat.
Let me press "right" and "down" to navigate to the RUN
option in the battle menu, and then press "a" to select
option in the battle menu, and then press "a" to select
