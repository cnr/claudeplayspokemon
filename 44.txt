<thinking>
I'm now at the battle menu with a Level 11 Zubat. The
cursor is currently on FIGHT, and I need to navigate to
RUN to escape the battle. To do this, I need to press
"right" to move to PkMn, and then "down" to move to RUN.
Let me press "right" first to move to PkMn.

Using tool: use_emulator - Buttons: ['right']
