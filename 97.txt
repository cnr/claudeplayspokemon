The Team Rocket Grunt is about to use ZUBAT, which is a
Poison/Flying type Pokémon. This is concerning for a few
reasons:
1. Sprou (Ivysaur) is a Grass/Poison type, and ZUBAT's
Flying-type moves would be super effective against Grass.
2. Sprou is already at critically low HP (10/69).
3. LEECH SEED won't be very effective as a recovery
strategy against ZUBAT because it's part Poison type.
However, I do have a couple of advantages:
1. Sprou is significantly higher level (24) than ZUBAT
(likely around level 13-15 based on the RATTATA).
2. Sprou still has VINE WHIP with 1 PP left, which could
potentially one-shot ZUBAT.
3. POISONPOWDER won't work on ZUBAT because it's already
Poison type.
At this point, I need to press "a" to advance the dialog,
and then the game will ask if I want to switch Pokémon or
keep Sprou in battle. Since both my other Pokémon are
fainted, I'll have to continue with Sprou.
