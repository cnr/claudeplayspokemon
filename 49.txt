<thinking>
I've successfully navigated to (37, 12) and can see that
there's a wall to the east at column 39, but there's a
navigable space at (38, 12). I should check that position
to see if there's a ladder or anything important in that
direction.
Looking at the navigator overlay, I can see:
1. There's a wall or barrier at column 39.
2. All coordinates in rows 8-11 are marked in red,
indicating they're inaccessible.
3. The coordinates (34, 15) and (35, 15) are marked in
red, suggesting there's a gap or elevation difference in
the bridge structure.
4. There appears to be a path extending southward at (36-
38, 16).
Let me navigate to (38, 12) to continue exploring eastward
and see if there's a ladder in that direction.
