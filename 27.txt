<thinking>
I see now that I've encountered a wild Geodude, not a
Zubat as I initially thought. The battle introduction
dialog is showing "Wild GEODUDE appeared!". I need to
press "a" to advance the dialog and then navigate to the
RUN option to escape this battle.
Given that Sprou is at critically low HP (10/69), running
from this battle is still the best option to preserve my
team's health. Let me press "a" to advance the dialog and
then navigate to RUN.
