<thinking>
I've reached (32, 24) and can see that:
1. There's a vertical column of lighter colored tiles at
columns 29-30, which appears to be a ladder or special
feature.
2. Coordinates (28-31, 20) through (28-31, 28) are marked
in red on the navigator overlay, indicating they're
inaccessible from my current position.
3. There's also a raised platform or different elevation
at the top left of the screen.
4. The path continues westward at row 28, but the
coordinates (28-31, 28) are marked in red.
Since there appears to be a ladder-like structure at
columns 29-30, this might be what I'm looking for - a
connection to the southern chamber of B1F (21, 17), which
is part of the exit path. However, I can't directly access
it from my current position.
I should explore further westward by navigating to (32,
28) to see if there's a path that leads to this ladder-
like structure.
