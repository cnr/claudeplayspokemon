I've reached (36, 24) and can see some key features:
1. There's a wall or barrier at rows 25-26, columns 35-38,
creating a dead end to the south.
2. However, there's a path extending westward at rows 24-
28, with navigable coordinates at (32-34, 24) through (32-
34, 28).
3. Below that, there appears to be a different elevation
or terrain type at rows 26-28, columns 35-38.
Let me explore the western path by navigating to (32, 24)
to see if there's a ladder or other feature in that
direction.
