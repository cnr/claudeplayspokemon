I've moved to (22, 10) and can see that there's now a path
available to the right. There are navigable spaces at (23,
12), (24, 12), (25, 12), (26, 12), and (27, 12), which
means I can go east and explore that direction.
I can see what appears to be a ladder in the upper right
corner at approximately (25, 9), but that coordinate is
still marked in red, indicating it's not directly
accessible. However, I can try to navigate to (27, 12) and
then explore northward to see if there's a path that leads
to the ladder.
Let me navigate to (27, 12) first to see what's in that
direction.
