<thinking>
I've reached (24, 31) and can see that the path continues
westward with navigable coordinates at (20-23, 31) through
(20-23, 32). There's a solid wall of rock at rows 27-30,
confirming that there's no direct path to the ladder-like
structure at columns 29-30.
Let me continue exploring westward by navigating to (20,
31) to see if there's a ladder or other feature that might
lead to the exit path.
